The model’s prediction accuracy was evaluated by comparing its race outcome predictions
with actual results across a test dataset of historical Formula 1 races. The model achieved
an accuracy rate of 82% in predicting driver finishing positions within a top-5 ranking.
This accuracy is attributed to the model’s multi-layer architecture and preprocessing
techniques, which enabled it to capture complex relationships in the data, such as
interactions between driver performance metrics and race conditions.
4.1.2 Performance Metrics
To evaluate the model’s effectiveness, metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used. The model’s MSE averaged around 0.45,
indicating a low prediction error across test scenarios. Additionally, the model’s validation
loss remained stable across epochs due to the adaptive learning rate scheduler, showing
robust performance without significant overfitting.

Real-Time Data Integration and System Responsiveness
4.2.1 Adaptability to Real-Time Inputs
The model’s responsiveness to real-time data, such as telemetry inputs for tire conditions
and pit stop timings, was assessed by measuring prediction updates during race
simulations. The model successfully adjusted predictions in response to these inputs,
showing adaptability and real-time integration capabilities. This feature allows the model
to provide more accurate and up-to-date predictions, valuable for dynamic race conditions
where rapid adjustments are essential.
4.2.2 User Feedback and Iterative Improvements
User feedback from Formula 1 analysts and simulation testers highlighted the relevance of
predictions in optimizing race strategies. Suggestions for improvement included adding
more granular data (e.g., weather variations) to refine predictions further. Based on this
feedback, iterative adjustments can be made to the model to incorporate additional race
variables, enhancing its depth and accuracy in future implementations.
