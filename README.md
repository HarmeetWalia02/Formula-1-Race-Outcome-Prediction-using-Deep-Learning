# Formula-1-Race-Outcome-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

Predicting Formula 1 race outcomes is challenging due to the complexity of racing data,
including driver stats, engine performance, and race conditions. Traditional models often
fail to capture these diverse factors, relying on outdated methods with limited accuracy.
This project develops an advanced neural network model designed for Formula 1 data,
improving predictive accuracy through deep neural network layers and comprehensive
preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and scaling.
Our model architecture integrates ReLU activation functions and dropout layers to capture
complex patterns and prevent overfitting. Training with a Mean Squared Error loss
function, the Adam optimizer, and a learning rate scheduler enables the model to achieve
reliable convergence and accurate predictions. Tested on historical data, the model
demonstrates enhanced performance in forecasting race outcomes, offering strategic
insights valuable for optimizing race strategies. This approach underscores the
effectiveness of neural networks in predictive analytics within Formula 1 and beyond,
offering a robust solution for handling complex, high-stakes data.
